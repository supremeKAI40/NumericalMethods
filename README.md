# NumericalMethods
A repository for all the python implementations for basic Numerical Methods used in Physics

Most Methods are simpler demonstrations and don't have separate methods to take inputs or calculate derivatives, but can be used by anyone to make it a full fledged independed program.

## Methods Included
1. FixedPoint Iteration <br>
2. Bisection Method <br>
3. Newton Raphson Method <br>
4. Regula Falsi Method <br>
5. Chebyshev Polynomial Method <br>
6. Gauss Seidel Method
7. LU Decomposition
8. Crout's Mehtod
9. Jacobi Method
10. Forward Difference Table
11. Simpsons 1_3 rule
12. Trapezoidal Method
13. Taylor Series Method
14. Euler Method
